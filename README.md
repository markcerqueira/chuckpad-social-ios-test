# hello-chuckpad

Sample iOS client that interacts with the [chuckpad-social][1] service. 
The iOS library code that interacts with the chuckpad-social server is stored as a git submodule (see [chuckpad-social-ios][2]).

If you are getting keychain write issues (FXKeychain failed to store data for key, error: -34018) try setting up [Keychain Access Groups][3].
